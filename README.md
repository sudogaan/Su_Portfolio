## Projects

[**Online Shopping Trends Analysis | SQL**](https://github.com/sudogaan/SQL-Projects/blob/main/Shopping%20Trends/shopping_trends.sql)
- Identified key shopping trends, customer behavior, and sales patterns to optimize inventory, marketing strategies, and customer retention efforts. By analyzing purchase frequency, spending habits, seasonal trends, and product performance, businesses can enhance customer segmentation, loyalty programs, and operational efficiency.
- Key Findings:
  Top Customers: Identified frequent buyers and high spenders for targeted loyalty programs.
  Customer Segments: Majority are mid-value customers, spending between 0.75x - 1.5x AOV.
  Best-Selling Products: Shirts lead in sales and revenue, while trousers perform the worst.
  Seasonal Trends: October sees the highest sales, while March has the lowest.
  Delivery Efficiency: Average delivery time is 14 days, highlighting potential logistics improvements.
  City Revenue: Port Hannahburgh contributes the most revenue ($7,632).
  Gender-Based Behavior: Female customers have the highest purchase frequency and total spend.
  Cart Abandonment: Identified customers who placed orders but never received deliveriesâ€”opportunity for retention strategies.
- SQL Techniques Used:Data filtering, joins, aggregations (SUM, COUNT, AVG), common table expressions (CTEs), CASE statements, and subqueries

[**Heart Attack Risk Analysis in Japan | SQL**](https://github.com/sudogaan/SQL-Projects/blob/main/Japan%20Heart%20Attack%20Data%20Analysis/Japan%20Heart%20Attack%20Analysis.sql)
- Analyzed the contribution of various factors to heart attack occurrences in Japan using SQL queries.
- Key Findings:
  Age & Heart Attack Risk: The average heart attack age is 48.78 years, with minimal variation across cases.
  Gender Influence: Men have a slightly higher heart attack rate, but overall, both genders are nearly equally affected.
  Geographical Influence: Urban and rural areas show similar heart attack rates, suggesting location is not a major risk factor.
  Smoking History: Smokers have a slightly higher risk, but most heart attack cases are from non-smokers, likely due to sample distribution.
  Cholesterol Levels: No significant difference between heart attack and non-heart attack patients, suggesting cholesterol alone is not a primary factor.
  BMI & Heart Attacks: Unexpectedly, obese individuals had a lower heart attack rate, possibly due to increased medical intervention.
  Family History: Individuals without a family history of heart disease had a slightly higher heart attack rate, contrary to common assumptions.
  Lifestyle Factors: A good diet and no alcohol consumption correlated with the highest recorded heart attack rate (10.67%), challenging traditional prevention assumptions.
- SQL Techniques Used: Data filtering, aggregation (COUNT, AVG, SUM), conditional case statements, grouping, ordering, and subqueries.
  
[**House Price Prediction Analysis | Advanced Regression Techniques | R**](https://github.com/sudogaan/House-Price-Prediction-Analysis-with-R/blob/main/House-Price-Prediction-Report.pdf)
- Explored dataset, conducted ANOVA analysis, and examined the correlation matrix to identify significant predictors influencing sale prices.
- Used backward model selection technique to identify influential variables for prediction and iteratively refined models to identify the best performing one.
- Utilized the trained model to predict house prices on a test dataset.
- Conclusions drawn from the analysis offer valuable insights for understanding and estimating house prices based on the dataset.

[**World Happiness Report Data Analysis | Python**](https://github.com/sudogaan/Data_Analysis_Projects/blob/main/World_Happiness_Report.ipynb)
- Analyzed the Kaggle Dataset of World Happiness Report made in 5 different years by using Python.
- Created charts and distributions to find the happiest countries each year and to determine the impacts of other factors in the happiness score of different countries by using Pandas, Numpy and Matplotlib.
